# Marketplace X – Logistics & Delivery Standards

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This policy defines how orders must be packed, shipped, and delivered when sellers fulfill orders themselves or use Marketplace X logistics programs. It covers handling times, packaging standards, carrier requirements, tracking, and delivery promises.

All sellers must comply with these standards for every order, regardless of product type or destination.

---

## 2. Fulfilment Models

### 2.1 Seller-Fulfilled Orders

In the seller-fulfilled model:

- Sellers store, pick, pack, and ship products directly to customers.
- Sellers are responsible for meeting handling time and delivery promises shown at checkout.
- Sellers must upload tracking information for shipments where a tracked service is used.

### 2.2 Fulfilled by Marketplace X (FBX)

Where available, sellers may enroll eligible products in the **Fulfilled by Marketplace X (FBX)** program:

- Sellers ship inventory to Marketplace X-operated or partner warehouses.
- Marketplace X handles storage, picking, packing, shipping, and basic customer service for delivery-related issues.
- FBX orders follow the same customer-facing delivery promises as shown at checkout; Marketplace X is responsible for operational execution.

Specific FBX terms and fees are defined in separate program documentation. The general principles of this policy still apply unless explicitly overridden by FBX terms.

## 3. Handling Time and Delivery Promises

### 3.1 Handling Time

**Handling time** is the time between order placement and shipment handover to the carrier.

- Sellers must set realistic handling times in their shipping settings.
- For standard shipping, the recommended maximum handling time is **2 business days**.
- For express shipping options, the recommended maximum handling time is **1 business day**.

Orders must be dispatched before the end of the stated handling time window to avoid late dispatches and protect the Late Dispatch Rate (LDR) metric.

### 3.2 Delivery Timeframes

The following are typical delivery timeframes for seller-fulfilled orders, subject to local market specifics:

- **Standard Shipping:** Estimated transit time of **3–6 business days** after dispatch.
- **Express Shipping:** Estimated transit time of **1–2 business days** after dispatch.

Sellers must only offer delivery options they can reliably meet with their chosen carriers. Delivery promises shown to customers must include both handling time and transit time.

### 3.3 Delivery Promise Accuracy

- Sellers must avoid overly optimistic delivery promises, as they directly affect Late Delivery Rate (LVR).
- If a systemic delay arises (e.g., carrier disruptions, weather events), sellers should adjust shipping templates and inform customers as needed.

Marketplace X may adjust or restrict a seller’s available shipping options if delivery performance is consistently poor.

## 4. Packaging Standards

### 4.1 General Requirements

Packaging must:

- Protect the product from damage during transport.
- Be appropriate for the product’s weight, shape, and fragility.
- Comply with carrier-specific requirements and local regulations.

Key expectations:

- Use sturdy outer packaging (e.g., corrugated boxes) for fragile or heavy items.
- Use cushioning materials (e.g., paper, bubble wrap) to reduce movement inside the box.
- Seal packages securely with appropriate tape.

### 4.2 Branding and Inserts

- Sellers may use branded packaging and inserts, provided they are professional and compliant with Marketplace X policies.
- Inserts may include care instructions, installation guides, and warranty information.
- Inserts must not explicitly encourage customers to shop off-platform or manipulate reviews (e.g., offering rewards for 5-star ratings).

### 4.3 Hazardous Materials and Special Handling

For products classified as hazardous or requiring special handling (e.g., liquids, sharp objects):

- Packaging must follow applicable safety regulations and carrier rules.
- Sharp edges must be safely covered.
- Liquids and powders must be sealed and protected against leakage.

Non-compliance may result in carrier refusal, customer complaints, or enforcement actions.

---

## 5. Carrier Selection and Tracking

### 5.1 Approved Carriers

- Sellers should work with reputable carriers offering reliable tracking and delivery performance.
- Local regulations or Marketplace X policies may restrict certain carriers for specific product types or destinations.

### 5.2 Tracking Requirements

For shipments where tracking is available:

- Sellers must upload valid tracking numbers to the order record promptly upon dispatch.
- Tracking must be scannable and recognized by the carrier’s system.
- Tracking information should show key events such as pick-up, in-transit status, and delivery confirmation.

Marketplace X calculates **Valid Tracking Rate (VTR)** based on tracking data quality and timeliness.

### 5.3 Delivery Confirmation

- For higher-value orders, signature-on-delivery or equivalent confirmation is recommended.
- Sellers should retain proof of delivery (e.g., carrier logs) in case of disputes.

---

## 6. Returns Logistics

### 6.1 Return Address and Method

Sellers must maintain a valid return address in each country where returns are accepted. This may be:

- The seller’s own address.
- A third-party logistics provider or returns centre.

Sellers must provide customers with clear instructions on how to return items, including:

- The return address.
- Preferred carrier or method.
- Any required documentation (e.g., return authorization number).

### 6.2 Prepaid Labels and Return Costs

- When the return is due to seller fault (e.g., damaged, incorrect, defective), sellers should provide prepaid return labels or equivalent arrangements.
- For customer-remorse returns, the seller may require the customer to pay return shipping, except where local laws require free returns.

Return cost responsibilities must align with Marketplace X’s general returns policy and local regulations.

### 6.3 Processing Returned Items

Upon receiving a returned item, sellers must:

- Inspect the item promptly for condition and completeness.
- Process refunds within **5 business days** of receipt or valid proof of return.
- Update inventory levels as appropriate.

For items returned in unusable condition due to customer misuse, sellers may adjust the refund according to local consumer law and Marketplace X guidelines.

---

## 7. Delivery Issues and Customer Communication

### 7.1 Proactive Communication

Sellers must monitor in-transit shipments and proactively communicate when issues arise, such as:

- Significant delays.
- Failed delivery attempts.
- Lost or damaged parcels.

Communication must be conducted via Marketplace X messaging tools and within **24 hours** of becoming aware of the issue.

### 7.2 Lost or Damaged Shipments

If a shipment is confirmed lost or arrives damaged:

- The seller remains responsible for resolving the issue with the customer.
- Solutions may include replacement shipments, refunds, or partial refunds, depending on circumstances and customer preference.
- The seller may pursue compensation from the carrier separately but should not delay customer resolution.

### 7.3 Incorrect or Missing Items

When the customer receives the wrong item or an incomplete order:

- The seller must acknowledge the issue and propose a resolution (replacement, partial refund, or full refund) within a reasonable timeframe.
- Return shipping for incorrect or incomplete orders is the seller’s responsibility.

Repeated issues may negatively impact the Order Defect Rate (ODR).

---

## 8. Performance Metrics Linked to Logistics

Logistics operations directly impact several key performance metrics defined in the Seller Performance Standards policy:

- **Late Dispatch Rate (LDR):** Affected by how quickly orders are picked, packed, and handed to the carrier.
- **Late Delivery Rate (LVR):** Influenced by the combination of handling time, delivery promises, and carrier performance.
- **Valid Tracking Rate (VTR):** Dependent on accurate and timely tracking uploads.
- **Order Defect Rate (ODR):** Impacted by delivery problems, damaged items, and poor packaging.

Sellers must design logistics processes to meet or exceed the minimum standards for these metrics.

---

## 9. Cross-Border Shipping

### 9.1 Customs Documentation

For cross-border orders, sellers must:

- Provide accurate customs declarations, including HS codes, product descriptions, and values.
- Comply with destination country regulations on prohibited or restricted items.
- Ensure that any duties and taxes responsibilities are clearly described in the listing or shipping settings.

### 9.2 Transit Times and Risk Management

- Cross-border shipments may require longer transit times; sellers must reflect this in delivery promises.
- Sellers should factor in potential delays due to customs clearance.
- For high-value or fragile items, additional insurance or protective packaging may be appropriate.

Marketplace X may limit cross-border shipping options for high-risk products or destinations.

---

## 10. Audits, Monitoring, and Improvements

### 10.1 Operational Audits

Marketplace X may review seller logistics operations, including:

- Handling times versus actual dispatch performance.
- Carrier choices and tracking quality.
- Customer feedback related to packaging and delivery.

Sellers may be asked to provide documentation such as carrier invoices or internal process descriptions.

### 10.2 Recommendations and Tooling

The Seller Console may provide:

- Shipping performance reports.
- Suggestions for adjusting handling times or shipping methods.
- Indicators of underperforming carriers or routes.

Sellers are encouraged to use this data to continuously optimize their logistics operations.

### 10.3 Consequences of Non-Compliance

Failure to comply with this Logistics & Delivery Standards policy may result in:

- Restriction of available shipping options.
- Removal of non-compliant listings.
- Account-level actions as outlined in the Penalty System & Enforcement policy.

Maintaining reliable logistics processes is essential for customer satisfaction and sustainable growth on Marketplace X.
