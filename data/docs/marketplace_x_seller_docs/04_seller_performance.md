# Marketplace X – Seller Performance Standards

## 1. Introduction

Marketplace X uses a set of performance metrics to assess seller reliability, customer experience, and operational quality. This policy defines those metrics, the minimum standards, and how performance is evaluated over time.

All sellers must maintain performance at or above the minimum standards to keep full selling privileges.

## 2. Key Performance Metrics

### 2.1 Order Defect Rate (ODR)

**Definition:** Percentage of orders with serious post-sale issues, calculated as:

- Orders with negative customer feedback (e.g., 1-star or 2-star rating where the comment relates to product or service quality).
- Valid customer disputes or claims decided in the customer’s favor.
- Confirmed chargebacks related to order issues.

**Formula:**

> ODR = (Number of defective orders / Total orders) × 100

**Standard:**

- Target ODR: **below 1.0%** on a rolling 60-day basis.
- ODR is evaluated only when there are at least 50 completed orders in the period.

### 2.2 Late Dispatch Rate (LDR)

**Definition:** Percentage of orders shipped after the maximum allowed handling time pledged at checkout.

**Formula:**

> LDR = (Number of orders dispatched late / Total orders) × 100

**Standard:**

- Target LDR: **4.0% or less** on a rolling 30-day basis, with at least 50 orders.

### 2.3 Late Delivery Rate (LVR)

**Definition:** Percentage of tracked orders delivered after the latest promised delivery date.

**Formula:**

> LVR = (Number of orders delivered late / Total tracked orders) × 100

**Standard:**

- Target LVR: **6.0% or less** on a rolling 30-day basis, with at least 50 tracked orders.

### 2.4 Pre-Fulfilment Cancellation Rate (PCR)

**Definition:** Percentage of orders cancelled by the seller before shipment, excluding cancellations requested by the customer.

**Formula:**

> PCR = (Number of orders cancelled by seller / Total orders) × 100

**Standard:**

- Target PCR: **2.5% or less** on a rolling 30-day basis, with at least 30 orders.

### 2.5 Valid Tracking Rate (VTR)

**Definition:** Percentage of shipped orders with valid, trackable shipping numbers uploaded on time.

**Formula:**

> VTR = (Orders with valid tracking / Total shipped orders) × 100

**Standard:**

- Target VTR: **95.0% or higher** on a rolling 30-day basis, with at least 30 shipped orders.

### 2.6 Customer Response Time

**Definition:** Percentage of customer messages answered within 24 hours.

**Standard:**

- Sellers must reply to at least **90%** of customer messages within **24 hours**, including weekends and holidays.

## 3. Evaluation Periods and Data Sources

### 3.1 Rolling Periods

- ODR is evaluated on a **60-day** rolling window.
- LDR, LVR, PCR, and VTR are evaluated on a **30-day** rolling window.
- Customer response time is evaluated on a **30-day** rolling window.

Where order volumes are low, Marketplace X may extend the evaluation period to ensure representative data.

### 3.2 Data Sources

- Performance metrics are calculated based on data captured by Marketplace X systems, including order timestamps, tracking events, and customer feedback.
- Seller-uploaded tracking data must match carrier tracking events to be considered valid.

Sellers can review their performance metrics at any time in the Seller Console.

## 4. Performance Tiers

Marketplace X groups sellers into performance tiers based on metrics and operational consistency. Tiers may influence eligibility for certain programs and promotions.

### 4.1 Priority Seller

- VTR at or above 98.0%.
- Customer response rate above 95% within 24 hours.

- Early access to new tools and programs.
- Eligibility for premium badges and marketing campaigns.

### 4.2 Standard Seller

Criteria:

- Meets minimum standards for all key metrics (ODR, LDR, LVR, PCR, VTR, response time).

Criteria (one or more of the below may apply):

- ODR between 1.0% and 1.5%.
- LDR above 4.0% but below 8.0%.
- LVR above 6.0% but below 10.0%.
- PCR above 2.5% but below 5.0%.

- Customer response rate below 90% but above 75%.

At-Risk Sellers may be subject to:

## 5. Root Cause Analysis and Corrective Actions

### 5.1 Identifying Performance Issues

Sellers should regularly review performance dashboards and identify:

- Spikes in late dispatch or late delivery.
- Increases in negative feedback.
- Patterns in cancellations or returns (e.g., sizing issues, poor packaging).

### 5.2 Typical Root Causes

Common causes of poor performance include:

- Overly optimistic handling times or delivery promises.
- Inaccurate stock management or overselling.
- Insufficient packaging leading to damage in transit.
- Misleading or incomplete product information.

### 5.3 Corrective Actions

Sellers must take timely actions such as:

- Increasing safety stock and improving inventory accuracy.
- Adjusting handling times and shipping methods to reflect real capabilities.
- Improving packaging materials and methods.
- Updating listings to clarify product features, dimensions, or compatibility.
- Training staff handling customer service to respond quickly and accurately.

Marketplace X may request a written performance improvement plan from underperforming sellers, detailing root causes, actions, and timelines.

## 6. Interaction with Customer Experience

### 6.1 Reviews and Feedback

- Customer reviews are a key indicator of service quality.
- Sellers should monitor reviews, respond to customer concerns when appropriate, and adjust operations accordingly.
- Attempts to manipulate reviews (e.g., incentives for positive feedback or discouraging honest reviews) are strictly prohibited.

### 6.2 Cancellations and Refunds

- Transparent policies and prompt resolution of issues help keep performance metrics within standards.
- Proactive communication with customers regarding delays or stock issues can reduce negative outcomes.
- Providing partial refunds, replacements, or goodwill gestures can improve customer satisfaction when issues arise, provided they comply with Marketplace X rules and local laws.

## 7. Account Reviews and Performance Monitoring

### 7.1 Regular Performance Reviews

Marketplace X may conduct:

- Automated reviews of seller metrics at regular intervals.
- Manual reviews for sellers with unusual patterns (e.g., sudden surge in negative feedback or cancellations).

### 7.2 Notifications and Warnings

If performance falls below the minimum standards, sellers may receive:

- Email and in-console notifications explaining which metrics are affected.
- Recommendations and tools to address issues.
- Deadlines to implement corrective actions and improve metrics.

### 7.3 Escalation to Enforcement

Persistent failure to meet the standards defined in this policy may lead to enforcement actions, including:

- Listing restrictions or category limitations.
- Temporary suspension of selling privileges.
- Withholding of disbursements in high-risk scenarios.
- Account termination in severe or unresolved cases.

Enforcement actions follow the principles described in the Penalty System & Enforcement policy, taking into account the severity, duration, and impact of performance issues.

## 9. Policy Updates and Seller Responsibilities

Marketplace X may update these Seller Performance Standards as operational needs and customer expectations evolve. Sellers must:

- Review performance policies regularly.
- Ensure internal processes, systems, and partners are aligned with current standards.

Maintaining strong performance is essential for long-term success on Marketplace X and directly influences visibility, customer trust, and eligibility for advanced selling programs.
