## 1. About Marketplace X

Marketplace X is a multi-category online marketplace that connects independent sellers with end customers. Marketplace X provides the platform, tools, and policies needed for safe, reliable, and compliant transactions. Sellers are independent businesses and remain responsible for their own operations, legal compliance, and customer experience.
