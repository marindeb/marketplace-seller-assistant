# Marketplace X – Listing Quality Standards

## 1. Purpose and Scope

High-quality listings are essential for a positive customer experience and strong conversion. This policy defines the minimum standards for product listings on Marketplace X, including titles, descriptions, images, attributes, pricing, and variations.

All sellers must comply with these standards for every listing, regardless of category or price point.

## 2. General Listing Principles

### 2.1 Accuracy and Honesty

- Product listings must accurately represent the item sold.
- The product received by the customer must match the listing in all material aspects: brand, model, specifications, quantity, condition, and included accessories.
- Claims such as “waterproof,” “genuine leather,” or “certified” must be truthful and supported by documentation if requested.

### 2.2 Single Product per Listing

- Each listing must refer to a single main product or a clearly defined set (e.g., “set of 4 chairs”).
- Bundles must be clearly identified and described as such.
- Different products must not be grouped into one listing as variants if they are materially different (e.g., a drill and a saw).

### 2.3 Prohibited Listing Practices

Sellers must not:

- Include phone numbers, email addresses, or external website URLs in titles, images, or descriptions.
- Use misleading keywords or brand names to attract traffic (e.g., referencing other brands that are not sold).
- Duplicate the same product in multiple listings within the same country, except where multi-pack or bundle logic requires separate offers.
- Include offensive, abusive, or inappropriate language.

Violations may lead to listing removal and account penalties.

## 3. Titles, Descriptions, and Bullet Points

### 3.1 Product Titles

Product titles must:

- Be concise, factual, and easy to understand.
- Typically follow this structure: **Brand – Key Product Name – Key Feature(s) – Size/Variant – Quantity**.
- Use correct spelling and capitalization (no ALL CAPS, except for standard abbreviations).

Examples of acceptable titles:

- “HomeCraft – Wooden Dining Chair – Oak Finish – 45 cm Seat Height – Set of 2”
- “GardenFlow – Adjustable Hose Nozzle – 8 Spray Patterns – Green”

Titles must not include:

- Promotional phrases (e.g., “Best seller”, “Free shipping”, “Limited offer”).
- Irrelevant keywords or competitor brand names.
- Excessive punctuation or symbols.

### 3.2 Bullet Points and Key Features

- Use bullet points to highlight key features and benefits (typically 3–7 bullets).
- Focus on the most important attributes: material, dimensions, compatibility, usage scenarios, key benefits.
- Do not repeat information from the title unless needed for clarity.

Bullet points must not include:

- Subjective claims without context (e.g., “perfect product”, “best on the market”).
- Offensive, discriminatory, or misleading statements.
- External contact information.

### 3.3 Product Descriptions

- Provide a clear, structured description of the product, including what is and is not included.
- Use short paragraphs and subheadings where helpful.
- Specify care instructions, installation requirements, and limitations of use.
- For technical products, include detailed specifications and compatibility notes.

Descriptions must be written in professional, neutral language and in the primary language of the marketplace region. Machine translation may be used but must be reviewed for accuracy.

## 4. Images and Media

### 4.1 Image Requirements

Each listing must include at least **one** image; **three to eight** images are recommended.

Images must:

- Be high-resolution (minimum 1,000 px on the longest side recommended).
- Show the actual product that will be received.
- Be well-lit, in focus, and free from excessive filters.
- Use a plain or neutral background for the main image where possible.
- Not contain watermarks, logos, or text overlays that obscure the product.

### 4.2 Prohibited Image Content

Images must not:

- Contain nudity or explicit content (except where strictly necessary for educational or medical products and allowed by category rules).
- Include external contact information or links (e.g., website URLs, QR codes leading outside Marketplace X).
- Misrepresent product size, color, or quantity.

### 4.3 Additional Media

Where supported, sellers may upload:

- Short product videos demonstrating use, installation, or key features.
- Diagrams or technical drawings for complex products (e.g., DIY components).

Additional media must comply with the same standards of accuracy and appropriateness as images.

## 5. Attributes, Variations, and Categorization

### 5.1 Required Attributes

Listings must include all required attributes for their category. Typical attributes include:

- Brand or manufacturer.
- Color and material.
- Dimensions and weight.
- Power rating (for electrical items).
- Package contents.
- Country of origin, where required.

Missing or incorrect attributes can result in suppressed visibility or removal from search.

### 5.2 Variations (Size, Color, etc.)

Variations may be used when:

- Products are essentially the same but differ in limited attributes such as size, color, length, or pattern.
- Customers would reasonably expect these options to appear together on one product page.

Variation misuse includes:

- Grouping unrelated products (e.g., different tools) as variants.
- Mixing used and new items in the same variation family.
- Combining products with significantly different features or price ranges.

Misused variations may be separated or removed by Marketplace X.

### 5.3 Category and Browse Node Selection

- Sellers must place products in the most relevant category and subcategory available.
- Incorrect categorization (e.g., placing tools in furniture) is prohibited and may result in suppressed visibility.
- When in doubt, sellers should choose the category that best reflects the primary intended use of the product.

Correct categorization is particularly important in Home, Garden, and DIY categories, where attribute sets and filters depend on category selection.

## 6. Pricing, Availability, and Shipping Information

### 6.1 Pricing Transparency

- Prices must be clearly stated in the marketplace currency.
- The price displayed must include all mandatory charges except shipping fees, which must be clearly shown separately where applicable.
- “Was/Now” or discount pricing must be truthful and comply with local pricing laws.

Sellers must not artificially raise prices before applying discounts or misrepresent the normal selling price.

### 6.2 Stock Availability

- Inventory quantities must be accurate and updated regularly.
- Sellers must avoid stock-outs by monitoring demand and adjusting inventory levels.
- Listings must be deactivated promptly when items become unavailable for an extended period.

Frequent cancellations due to out-of-stock items negatively impact seller performance metrics.

### 6.3 Shipping Options and Delivery Promises

- Sellers must configure shipping methods consistent with their actual capabilities.
- Delivery time promises shown to customers must be realistic and achievable for the chosen carriers and handling times.
- Any shipping restrictions (e.g., cannot ship to islands or remote areas) must be clearly specified in the listing or shipping settings.

The Logistics & Delivery Standards policy details handling time and delivery expectations.

## 7. Compliance, Safety, and Documentation

### 7.1 Regulatory and Safety Information

For regulated products, listings must include:

- Required warnings and safety statements.
- Regulatory certifications (e.g., electrical safety marks) where applicable.
- Age recommendations and usage limitations.

Sellers must ensure that all statements are accurate and supported by documentation upon request.

### 7.2 Documentation and Manuals

Where relevant, listings must indicate whether the product includes:

- User manuals or instructions.
- Installation guides.
- Warranty documentation.

If documentation is digital (e.g., downloadable PDF), this must be clearly specified.

### 7.3 Environmental and Sustainability Claims

Environmental claims (e.g., “recyclable”, “biodegradable”) must be:

- Specific and accurate.
- Compliant with applicable environmental marketing regulations.
- Supported by evidence if requested.

Vague claims such as “eco-friendly” without context should be avoided.

## 8. Monitoring, Quality Control, and Consequences

### 8.1 Listing Review and Optimization

Marketplace X may:

- Automatically review listings for missing attributes, poor image quality, or non-compliant content.
- Suppress or hide listings that do not meet minimum quality thresholds.
- Provide recommendations through the Seller Console to improve titles, attributes, or images.

Sellers are encouraged to review listing quality reports regularly and apply suggested improvements.

### 8.2 Customer Feedback and Content Updates

- Customer questions and reviews may reveal missing or unclear information.
- Sellers should update listings proactively to address recurring questions or misunderstandings.
- Misleading listings must be corrected immediately.

### 8.3 Enforcement of Listing Quality Standards

If a listing repeatedly fails to comply with these standards or generates a high rate of customer complaints, Marketplace X may:

- Remove or temporarily disable the listing.
- Restrict the ability to list new items in specific categories.
- Apply account-level penalties in line with the Penalty System & Enforcement policy.

Maintaining high listing quality is essential for long-term success on Marketplace X and directly influences customer satisfaction and seller performance metrics.
