# Marketplace X – Category Guidelines: Home / Garden / DIY

## 1. Scope

These guidelines provide category-specific rules and best practices for listing products in the **Home**, **Garden**, and **DIY** categories on Marketplace X. They complement general policies such as Listing Quality Standards, Prohibited & Restricted Products, and Logistics & Delivery Standards.

Where these guidelines conflict with general policies, the stricter requirement applies.

## 4. Safety, Compliance, and Usage Information

### 4.1 Safety Warnings

For products with inherent risks (sharp tools, heavy furniture, electrical items):

- Include clear warnings in the description (e.g., “Keep out of reach of children”).
- Provide safe usage instructions and protective equipment recommendations where appropriate (e.g., “Wear eye protection while operating”).

### 4.2 Regulatory Compliance

Depending on region and product type, sellers may need to demonstrate compliance with:

- Electrical safety standards for lighting and power tools.
- Chemical regulations for paints, sealants, and treatments.
- Environmental standards for pressure-treated wood or similar materials.

Relevant certifications must be reflected in the listing and supporting documentation must be available on request.

### 4.3 Installation and Professional Services

For items requiring professional installation (e.g., electrical fixtures, certain plumbing components):

- Clearly state that installation must be done by a qualified professional where required by law or recommended for safety.
- Do not encourage unqualified customers to perform regulated installations themselves.

## 5. Listing Quality Expectations for Home / Garden / DIY

### 5.1 Images

- Provide multiple images showing the product from different angles.
- For furniture and décor, include context images in realistic settings to show scale and style.
- For tools and DIY materials, show close-ups of functional components (e.g., drill chuck, blade teeth, joint details).

Images must remain accurate and must not alter the apparent size, color, or finish in a misleading way.

### 5.2 Dimensions and Scale

- Always include measurements in the description and bullet points for items where size matters (e.g., furniture, storage, shelving).
- For wall-mounted items, specify recommended fixing type and spacing where possible.
- For textiles (bedding, curtains), include dimensions and suitable bed or window sizes.

### 5.3 Condition and Component Completeness

- Clearly state the condition (new, refurbished, etc.), subject to Marketplace X’s allowed conditions.
- List all components included (e.g., tools, screws, brackets, assembly kit).
- If fixings are not included, state this explicitly and specify the type required.

## 6. Returns and After-Sales Considerations

### 6.1 Product Suitability and Returns

To reduce avoidable returns:

- Provide clear information about dimensions, materials, and finishes so customers can assess suitability.
- For color-sensitive items (e.g., décor, textiles), clarify that screens can display colors differently and provide descriptive color names.

High return rates due to misaligned expectations may affect performance evaluations.

### 6.2 Faulty or Damaged Items

- For fragile items (e.g., glass furniture, ceramic planters), ensure robust packaging.
- If items frequently arrive damaged, review packaging and carriers, and adjust as necessary.
- Replace or refund faulty or damaged items in line with general Marketplace X returns policies and applicable consumer law.

### 6.3 Spare Parts and Consumables

For products that require consumables or spare parts (e.g., filters, blades, bulbs):

- Indicate compatible replacement part references.
- Where possible, offer compatible spare parts as separate listings and reference them in descriptions.

---

## 7. Prohibited and Restricted Items in Home / Garden / DIY

Sellers must follow the general Prohibited & Restricted Products policy, with particular attention to:

- **Hazardous chemicals** (e.g., certain pesticides, restricted wood treatments).
- **High-risk tools** (e.g., chainsaws, table saws) in regions where additional certification or restrictions apply.
- **Electrical items** that do not meet local safety standards.

Where additional approvals or documentation are required within the Home / Garden / DIY categories, sellers must obtain approval before listing.

---

## 8. Best Practices for Category Success

### 8.1 Home – Style and Compatibility

- Provide style descriptors (e.g., “modern”, “industrial”, “Scandinavian”) consistently, but only where accurate.
- Mention compatibility with other items in your range (e.g., “matches the HomeCraft Nova dining table”).

### 8.2 Garden – Weather and Seasonal Considerations

- Clearly state whether items are suitable for year-round outdoor use or require seasonal storage.
- Provide guidance on protection (covers, storage, maintenance) to maximize product lifespan.
- Consider seasonality when planning inventory (e.g., garden furniture demand peaks in spring and summer).

### 8.3 DIY – Skill Level and Tools Required

- Indicate the recommended skill level for DIY products (e.g., beginner, intermediate, advanced).
- List tools required for assembly or installation (e.g., screwdriver, drill, wrench).
- For more complex projects, provide links (within Marketplace X) to complementing tools or accessories.

## 9. Monitoring, Feedback, and Continuous Improvement

### 9.1 Using Customer Feedback

- Monitor reviews for recurring complaints about dimensions, durability, or installation difficulty.
- Update listings to address common issues and clarify expectations.
- Work with suppliers to address quality issues highlighted by customers.

### 9.2 Category-Specific Metrics

While general performance metrics apply across all categories, sellers should pay particular attention to:

- Return reasons related to “not as described” or “does not fit”.
- Delivery damage rates for large or fragile items.
- Repeat purchases within product lines (e.g., additional chairs for a set, extra storage units).

Using these insights can help refine product selection, packaging, and listing content.

## 10. Summary

Success in the Home, Garden, and DIY categories depends on:

- Detailed, accurate product information, especially dimensions, materials, and usage.
- Clear safety and installation guidance.
- Robust packaging and reliable logistics.
- Continuous improvement based on customer feedback and category performance data.

These guidelines should be applied together with all other Marketplace X policies to provide customers with the information and confidence needed to buy and use products safely and effectively.
